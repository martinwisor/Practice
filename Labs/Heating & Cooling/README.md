Heating/Cooling:
Define two variables: actualTemp and a desiredTemp. Write conditionals to tell the heating & cooling system what to do. Log one of these three things: Run A/C, Run heat, or Standby.

Extended Challenge:
Start with two variables: tempCelsius (a number) and targetUnit (a string, either “C”, “F”, or “K”). Write a switch statement that checks the targetUnit and logs the temperature converted to that unit. Notes: K stands for Kelvin. C requires no conversion, print out the original temp.
