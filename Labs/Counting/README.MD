Skills: Loops

Counting Loops:
Use a for loop to log numbers from 1 to 10, then another for loop to count down, logging numbers from 10 to 1.
Repeat the exercise with a while loop.
Repeat with a do while loop.
Create this array: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Use a for…of loop to loop through the array and log all the numbers. (Note: we’re not asking you to also count down on this one.)

Extended Challenge:
Given any string, use a loop to add padding (extra spaces) to the front to make the string ten characters long. For example, given the string “planet”, log “    planet” (add four spaces), and for the string “headlamp”, log “  headlamp” (add two spaces).
